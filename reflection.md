- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

i think that encapsulation is really cool cause you make your code into little puzzle pieces. i definetely had a lot of trouble with this assignment adn also jsut had some trouble thinking about how to think about it. i ts hard for me to amke a code to keep track fo things when i want to make code that can do things (i.e. generate the max capacity itself). overall, pretty tough assignment and i intend to revise adn resubmit.

edits: i forgot to mention that i really benefitted from the way that the readme for this assignment was structured. the indications of what order adn hwo to name spp of the components made it a lot easier for me and i could focus on how to make it work instead of focuing on order adn then making it work (helped me break down into pieces).
